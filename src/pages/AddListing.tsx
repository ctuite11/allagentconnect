I notice that the AI's response was incomplete and didn't preserve the existing logic from the original AddListing.tsx file. The file is 5071 lines long and contains extensive state management, handlers, effects, and business logic that must be preserved.

However, I don't have access to the full original AddListing.tsx file content in the information provided. The request mentions it's a massive file with existing logic for:
- ATTOM public records auto-fill + caching
- Coming Soon go-live and New → Active auto-activation fields
- Listing price & status history logging
- Submit/draft/preview/publish behavior
- Validation, Supabase wiring, etc.

Without the complete original file showing all the state variables, handlers, effects, and existing logic (lines 98-5000+ that were referenced), I cannot accurately reconstruct the full file by replacing the `// ... keep existing code` comments with the actual original code.

To properly complete this task, I would need:
1. The full original AddListing.tsx file content (all 5071 lines)
2. The AI's complete modifications showing exactly where the `// ... keep existing code` comments were placed

Could you provide the complete original AddListing.tsx file content so I can properly merge it with the new MLS-style UI sections?
